/**
 * Agent-editable registry of publicly-crawlable routes. Consumed by the
 * /sitemap.xml handler in src/server/entry.ts.
 *
 * Guidelines for maintaining this file:
 * - Static public paths are synced automatically from src/routes.tsx.
 * - Do not include dynamic-param routes like "/products/:id" directly.
 *   Instead, enumerate real values (e.g. "/products/desk-pro") or skip.
 * - `path` MUST start with "/".
 * - Priorities are between 0.0 and 1.0. Home = 1.0, main sections = 0.8,
 *   deep pages = 0.5.
 * - Dev-only or auth-required routes MUST NOT be listed.
